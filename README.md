Bike sharing service analysis is a project based on the data that is gathered form the bike service based out in Washington. Apart from interesting real-world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the
research. In this project, there were two objectives,
1. The environmental factors which affect the bike hiring count per day the most.
2. Forecasting the bike hiring count per day.
